    /** 
    
        1.Thousands of Web2 businesses have weaknesses due to their centralized nature, 
        where the owner can suddenly change the rules of the system, which of course, harms the users.

        2.The majority of businesses only last 1-2 years, so why should we work hard or even smart to develop them?

        3.Inflation is very real, reaching up to 12% in a year. This quickly erodes a person's wealth in an almost invisible way.
        
        4. Starting any business, whether offline or online, makes it very difficult to break even. Even if it's possible, 
        it takes a very long time. On Holdplatform.com, your capital will return 88% within just 1 year with a 6% monthly unlock rate.

        5. Holdplatform is the best place for you to practice DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) in Bitcoin. 
        In addition to increasing your Bitcoin holdings, you can also run its affiliate business.

        6. The founder has the best experience in affiliate marketing across various businesses since 2009 and 
        wants to help you succeed in affiliate marketing because becoming an affiliate is the best way to make money.

        7. The bank uses a Fractional Reserve Banking system with a 1:10 ratio, 
        meaning that for every $10,000 of your money, up to $9,000 has been used for loans and other purposes. 
        The Holdplatform is open-source, and 88% of your token is safe. The deployer cannot touch or use your token.

        ✦✦✦✦✦✦✦

        There are only two choices right now: either the value of your fiat wealth decreases by 12% due to inflation, 
        or your WBTC decreases by 12% on Holdplatform. However, with the potential for unlimited affiliate bonuses 
        and, of course, the likely increase in BTC prices, which will surely be more than 12% in the coming time, 
        
        ✦ Holdplatform offers a better opportunity.
    */


    // -----------------------------------------
    // ✦ I'd rather keep my WBTC myself.
    // -----------------------------------------

    /** 
        1. If you have less than 0.1 BTC, it is highly discouraged to keep it yourself. It won't make you rich.
        2. If people can keep their money themselves, why do so many store it in banks?
        3. If everyone can cook, why do so many people go to restaurants where it's 50% more expensive than cooking at home?
        4. If water at home is cheap, or even free, why do so many people buy bottled water at the convenience store?

        ✦✦✦✦

        Because for some people, keeping money in a bank, eating at a restaurant, and drinking bottled water are better options. 
        Similarly, Holdplatform is the best way to protect against inflation and start an affiliate business with minimal risk, 
        as Holdplatform uses WEB3, which is, of course, more transparent and much safer than WEB2 businesses.

    // ✦ How the system works
    // -----------------------------------------

    /** 

        -----------------------
        ••• Deployment phase
        -----------------------
        1. The deployer performs the deployment on Remix on the chain being used
        2. The constructor will automatically create the data for the first time for the msg.sender as the deployer. 
        3. The data includes : _idnumber, _holdstatus_bycashbackcode, _searchaddress_bycashbackcode, readdata 
        4. In addition, it also stores deployer data, which consists of mapping(address => User) private _user
        5. Contains permanent data : u.useraddress, u.cashbackcode, u.affiliateid, u.status, u.unixregister, u.firsttimebuybitcoin 
        
        -----------------------
        ••• Launch phase
        -----------------------
        1. The deployer must press the write button for the (Start) function, which will automatically change 0 to the block.timestamp data, and the Dapps can be used.
        2. Once the launch unixtime is successfully updated, it cannot be undone, paused, or even stopped. The smart contract will run forever

        -----------------------
        ••• Add Contract
        -----------------------
        1. Unlike Uniswap, where all users can input the contract address being used, on the Holdplatform, only the deployer can add a new contract address.
        2. The deployer add at least one contract address that can be used permanently. This cannot be paused or stopped.
        3. As an example, the deployer will add the WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) token with three important parameters.
        4. The parameters are the contract address, maximum contribution, and the percentage of unlocked tokens per month.
        5. Although the percentage is calculated monthly, in reality, the system calculates it per second
        6. And it can be withdrawn at any time with a maximum accumulation of 10% (if the contract duration has not yet ended).
        7. If the contract duration has ended, then when the user presses the withdraw button, all tokens will be unlocked and sent.
        8. The data that can be updated for the next hold are the percentage of tokens unlocked per month and the maximum contribution amount.
        9. Updates do not apply retroactively and will not change the conditions for existing users who have already held tokens.
        10. The unlock percentage can be changed to a range of 3-12% per month. 
        11. For the maximum contribution, it must be greater than the previous maximum contribution amount.
        12. Creating or updating the maximum contribution must include the token amount in decimals. For example, 100 tokens with 8 decimals should be written as 10000000000

        -----------------------
        ••• Holdplatform
        -----------------------
        1. To participate in holdplatform.com, users must Sign the Disclaimer, and this agreement is recorded on the blockchain.
        2. To participate in locking tokens on the Holdplatform, users can use a cashback code from an inviter or choose not to use a cashback code at all.
        3. Users who use a cashback code will receive a 16% cashback from the total tokens locked, both for the first token lock and subsequent token locks.
        4. Users who do not use a cashback code will not receive a 16% cashback from the total tokens locked for the first token lock. 
        5. However, for the second and subsequent token locks, they will still receive the cashback. The 16% cashback can be withdrawn immediately, even after just 1 second.
        6. Token distribution system: 2% for the deployer, 10% for affiliates, 16% for user cashback, and 72% will be locked for several months based on the specified percentage.
        7. Users who do not use a cashback code will have the 16% tokens marked as not eligible, and they will be added to the deployer's balance.
        -----------------------
        ••• Example
        -----------------------
        For example, the system currently has the WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) contract address registered with a 
        Max Contribution of 0.1 BTC, or with decimals as 10,000,000, and an unlock percentage of 6% per month.

        Someone is holding tokens and has already saved a cashback code. 
        This user locked 0.1 BTC at the unixtime 1723691458 (Thu Aug 15 2024 03:10:58 GMT) Then the result is :

        - One second after making the deposit, 
        the user can withdraw the 16% x 0.1 WBTC cashback at unixtime 1723691459 (Thu Aug 15 2024 03:10:59 GMT) --- > 0.016 WBTC
        - One second after making the deposit, 
        the affiliate can withdraw the 10% x 0.1 WBTC cashback at unixtime 1723691459 (Thu Aug 15 2024 03:10:59 GMT) --- > 0.01 WBTC
        - One second after making the deposit, 
        the deployer can withdraw the 2% x 0.1 WBTC cashback at unixtime 1723691459 (Thu Aug 15 2024 03:10:59 GMT) --- > 0.002 WBTC

        72% of the tokens (0.072 WBTC) will be locked for 12 months (31,104,000 seconds), 
        and the tokens will unlock every second at a rate of 6% per month, 0.2% per day, or 0.00833% per hour.

        The user can leave the tokens locked. If at any time the user wishes to withdraw, 
        they can accumulate up to a maximum of 10% if the contract duration has not yet ended.

        If the contract duration has ended at the unixtime 1754795458 (Sun Aug 10 2025 03:10:58 GMT), the user can withdraw everything. 

        -----------------------------------
        ••• Holdplatform Affiliate System 
        -----------------------------------
        By making a token deposit on the Holdplatform at least once, with any amount, your cashback code becomes active and can be used for promotion

        Make sure you have made a deposit with the maximum amount specified by the max contribution. 
        This way, if any of your referrals make a deposit, you can receive the full 10% bonus.

        ✦ Holdplatform uses ACS (Anti Cheat System).
        It is not possible for account-1 to make a small deposit and then account-2 to make a large deposit, 
        as the referral bonus calculation is based on 10% x Bonus Parameter.

        ✦ What is Bonus Parameter ?
        The bonus parameter is the reference used to measure the affiliate bonus you can receive, up to 10%. 
        The bonus parameter is calculated based on the amount of your token deposit that has not yet been withdrawn. 
        You are free to withdraw the tokens you hold, but keep in mind that every time you withdraw the tokens you hold, 
        your bonus parameter decreases. The bonus parameter can increase again up to the max contribution if you deposit again up to the maximum.

        ⫸⫸⫸ Withdrawing tokens reduces the bonus parameter.
        ⫸⫸⫸ Withdrawing the affiliate bonus does not reduce the bonus parameter. 

        Here is the detailed bonus calculation :

        ✦ Bonus Type 1
        ⁎ Example : Your Deposit 0.05 BTC == > Your Bonus Paramater 0.05 BTC --- Referral OLD Contribution = 0 BTC, Referral NEW Contribution 0.05 BTC
        -- if ( Referral_OldContribution == 0 && Your_BonusParameter >= Referral_NewContribution )
        -- Affiliate Bonus  = 10% x Referral_NewContribution
        -- Not Eligible     = 0%

        ✦ Bonus Type 2
        ⁎ Example : Your Deposit 0.05 BTC == > Your Bonus Paramater 0.05 BTC --- Referral OLD Contribution = 0 BTC, Referral NEW Contribution 0.09 BTC
        -- if ( Referral_OldContribution == 0 && Your_BonusParameter < Referral_NewContribution )
        -- Affiliate Bonus  = 10% x Your_BonusParameter
        -- Not Eligible     = 10% x ( Referral_NewContribution - Your_BonusParameter )

        ✦ Bonus Type 3
        ⁎ Example : Your Deposit 0.05 BTC == > Your Bonus Paramater 0.05 BTC --- Referral OLD Contribution = 0.06 BTC, Referral NEW Contribution 0.04 BTC
        -- if ( Referral_OldContribution > Your_BonusParameter  )
        -- Affiliate Bonus  = 0%
        -- Not Eligible     = 10% x Referral_NewContribution

        ✦ Bonus Type 4
         ⁎ Example :  Your Deposit 0.05 BTC == > Your Bonus Paramater 0.05 BTC ---  Referral OLD Contribution = 0.02 BTC,  Referral NEW Contribution 0.02 BTC
        -- if ( Referral_OldContribution > 0 &&  AllContribution <= Your_BonusParameter)
        -- Affiliate Bonus  = 10% x Referral_NewContribution
        -- Not Eligible     = 0%

        ✦ Bonus Type 5
        ⁎ Example : Your Deposit 0.05 BTC == > Your Bonus Paramater 0.05 BTC --- Referral OLD Contribution = 0.02 BTC, Referral NEW Contribution 0.08 BTC
        -- if ( Referral_OldContribution > 0 &&  AllContribution > Your_BonusParameter )
        -- Affiliate Bonus  = 10% x ( Your_BonusParameter - Referral_OldContribution )
        -- Not Eligible     = 10% x ( AllContribution - Your_BonusParameter )

        -----------------------
        ••• Withdraw
        -----------------------
        1. Anyone who has stored tokens can perform a partial withdrawal or withdraw everything when the contract ends.
        2. A referrer can withdraw the affiliate bonus they have received from the combined total of all bonuses they have received, at any time!
        3. The deployer can withdraw the 2% Holdplatform fee and the percentage that is not eligible at any time.

        -----------------------
        ••• Best Practice
        -----------------------

        - Deposit as much as you can up to the maximum contribution. To ensure that your bonus parameters do not decrease, 
        do not withdraw tokens from your deposit. Instead, withdraw from the affiliate bonus earned from your efforts in promoting the Holdplatform.
